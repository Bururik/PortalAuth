# PortalAuth
Captive portal cloner and payload distributor for the WiFi Pineapple NANO and TETRA

This module is still in development and some features are not available although the controls may be present.  This module relies on Evil Portal to display captive portals but also has features that work well on their own.  Download a copy, test it out, and provide feedback in the [Hak5 forums](https://forums.hak5.org/index.php?/topic/37448-portal-auth/) or on Twitter (@sudonick).
